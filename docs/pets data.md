'''Pets''' are a core feature added to ''Grow a Garden'' in [[Update Log/1.04.0|Update 1.04.0]]. 

Pets have unique abilities, having multiple of the same pets can stack their abilities. Players start with '''3''' equip slots, but can get an additional '''5''' slots from buying gamepasses from the [[Limited Time Shop]] and/or trading aged pets in. 

Players can hold a maximum of '''60''' pets in their [[inventory]]. As of the [[Prehistoric Event]] players can increase it by buying gamepasses in the [[Limited Time Shop]] or trading aged pets in.

This limit can be bypassed by buying [[Pet Eggs|pet eggs]] instead of hatching them. Keep in mind that to hatch an egg, the player must first delete or sell pets to make space.

== <u>Obtainable Pets</u> ==
These pets can be obtained through normal game play and do not require trading, testing rights, or admin rights.

== Mechanics ==

=== <u>Age</u> ===
'''Age''' is a pet feature which increases over time through '''XP''' (''to order to increase the Age, It must maintain it's Hunger''). 

As the pet gets older, the amount of XP required for the pet to age will increase, but it will also improve the pet's trait by either giving it a shorter cooldown, better chances, and other various buffs. A pet cannot age if it's hunger bar reaches 0. 

The player can view their pet's age by clicking on the pet and choosing the "view" option, picking it up and stomping on it through their inventory, or pressing the '''<<''' button on the right side of their screen and viewing the pet menu.

''The following table is the XP requirement for a pet to age at different ages.''
{| class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed fandom-table" width=25%
|+Disclaimer: The table is not finished, about half of the values are uncertain and predicted by the formula "floor(20*n^2.02)". More Information: [https://www.desmos.com/calculator/zqzdepe3mr?lang=en Graph]

=== <u>Hunger & Feeding</u> ===
''Hunger ''is a pet feature which is required in order for the pet to grow older. When the hunger bar reaches 0, the pet can no longer grow. To feed a pet, simply equip any crop from the player's inventory and move closer to the player's pet. The player can either click the pet and press the "Feed" option, or hold the interact button that appears once the player gets closer. The player can also feed their pet through the pet menu, by equipping the desired crop to be fed and selecting feed. Once a pet has been fed, a short message will appear showing a percentage by how much hunger has been restored from the player's pet. The mutation and type of fruit depends on how much a pet's hunger has been restored. Each pet can have different hunger bars, which can depend on their rarity. The player can view's the player's pet's hunger by clicking on the pet and choosing the view option, hovering the cursor over the player's pet, or by opening the pet menu by clicking the 2 white arrows on the right side of the screen.

== Trivia ==
*Sometimes when feeding pets, their names in the proximity prompt will be their UUID (a random string of numbers inside curly brackets).
* There is a limit of 60 pets that can be inside the [[inventory]]. Players can extend this by trading in aged pets.
* There was a bug where, if the player hovered over each of the stats when viewing a pet, the wrong descriptions would appear.
* The '''Pet Menu''' added in [[Update Log/1.07.0|Update 1.07.0]] allows players to easily feed and pick up their pets by clicking 2 white arrows (<<) on the right side of the screen without having to chase their pets. It also allows players to check their pets age and XP.
* Hatching from any egg can make pets huge with a chance of 0.01%
* All pets are covered in classic studs (2017)
* As of 2nd of July, players '''can not''' trade pets. This will be fixed soon.
* There are currently no Prismatic pets
