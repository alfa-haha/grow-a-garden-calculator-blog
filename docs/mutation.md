== About ==
'''Mutations''' are unique visual transformations that increase the price of the fruits, making them more visually recognizable and profitable.

These changes can be triggered by specific in-game conditions like [[weather]], certain [[Gears|tools]] or special seeds. Certain mutations are significantly rarer than others, but yield a higher {{Sheckle}} multiplier.

One mutation, Dawnbound, can only be applied on the [[Sunflower]]. which makes [[Sunflower]] the only plant with an exclusive mutation.

== Price Calculation ==
The price of a fruit is decided by the formula:

<math>\text{Total Price} = \text{Base Value} \times \left(1 + \sum \text{Mutations} - \text{Number of Mutations}\right) \times \text{Growth Mutation} \times \left( \frac{\text{Weight}}{\text{Base Weight}} \right)^2
</math>

Where:
* '''Weight''' = The weight, in kilograms, of the fruit
* '''Base Value''' = The plant's base value
* '''Base Weight''' = The plant's base weight
* '''Growth Mutation''', one of:  
** None (×1)
** Ripe (x1)
** Gold (×20)
** Rainbow (×50)
* '''ΣMutations''' = Sum of all applicable environmental mutation bonuses
* '''Mutation Amount''' = Amount of unique environmental mutations applied

=== <u>Rules</u> ===
* Only '''one''' of either Golden or Rainbow can be applied.
* Only '''one''' of either Chilled, Wet, Drenched, or Frozen can be applied.
* Only '''one''' of either Burnt or Cooked can be applied.
* Only '''one''' of either Verdant, Sundried or Paradisal can be applied.
* Only '''one''' of either Sandy, Clay, Wet or Drenched can be applied.
* Only '''one''' of either Ceramic, Burnt, Fried, Cooked, Molten or Clay can be applied.
* Cooked '''replaces''' Burnt
* AncientAmber '''replaces''' OldAmber which '''replaces''' Amber
* Drenched '''replaces''' Wet

== Trivia ==
* Moonlit, Bloodlit, Zombified, Gold (Only when a [[Dragonfly]] applies it), Rainbow (Only when a [[Butterfly]] applies it), Disco (Only when a [[Disco Bee]] applies it), Pollinated, Burnt, Chilled/Frozen (Only when a [[Polar Bear]] applies it), Burnt/Cooked (Only when a [[Cooked Owl]] applies it), and Verdant (Only when a [[Scarlet Macaw]] applies it) mutations give a notification on the player's screen when the mutation affects a fruit. These are the only mutations to do this.
* The highest possible mutation multiplier on a fruit is 47,950, except for [[Sunflower]], where the highest possible multiplier is 56,300.00.
* Ripe is the only mutation that cannot multiply, as it is only for looks.
* Dawnbound and Amber is the only mutation that can be given after fruit is picked up.
* If a Flower-type plant is Wet/Chilled, and a player uses the [[Flower Froster Sprinkler]] on it, it will mutate to Frozen while still keeping the Wet/Chilled mutation. This is most likely a bug. Intended effect (most likely) is for it to become frozen, removing wet/chilled.
* Non multi-harvest crops or crops affected by the Magnifying Glass can be hovered over with the player's mouse to see their mutations. 
* The only mutations that can only be applied on one type of plant are Ripe ([[Sugar Apple]]), and Dawnbound ([[Sunflower]]).
* Amber is the first ever mutation that has multiple stages.
