== Overview ==
'''Pet Eggs''' can be purchased from the [[Pet Eggs|Pet Egg Shop]], which refresh every ''30 minutes'', or can be obtained through different limited events and [[crafting]].

Hatching eggs is required in order to obtain a pet (with a few exceptions such as the [[Panda]] and [[Blood Owl]]). A player can hatch an egg by equipping an egg from their inventory and placing it on any space of their plot. Then, the player waits until the egg hatches.

The player can speed up the process by choosing to skip its growth which costs {{Robux}}, or the player can use pets that decrease the hatch time such as [[Chicken|Chickens]], [[Rooster|Roosters]], [[Bald Eagle]], or [[Blood Kiwi|Blood Kiwis]]. The player can only hatch '''3''' eggs at a time at minimum and can be increased by buying in the shop with {{Robux}} and/or trading aged pets, where the player can add up to '''5''' extra slots.

== Eggs List ==
To obtain pets, players need to buy eggs. These eggs cannot be gifted and can be obtained through normal gameplay. Each egg has a chance to give different pets.
